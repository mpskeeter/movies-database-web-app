[Live website](https://ngmvdb.netlify.app/movies)

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.0.0.

#### This is a movies database web app with basic features built to demonstrate my Angular development skills using [The Movies Database API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction).

## Features
- See currently trending (daily), popular and top rated movies.
- Search for movies (and similar movies) by name.
- See accurate movie details plus videos on click. Additional recommended movies are returned if available.
- Sort movies by genre to quickly find your choice.
- Add movies to a favorites list by clicking on the heart icon to check them out later.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
